Daraz's refund policy allows for returns or refunds on items that are damaged, defective, incorrect, or incomplete. However, for device-related issues after usage or beyond the return policy period, it is recommended to check if the item is covered under Seller or Brand Warranty. Items that are non-returnable include any custom-made items. For Buy More, Save More orders, partial cancellations are not permitted, but partial returns are allowed. This means that if you wish to return certain items from a Buy More, Save More order, you can do so, but you would need to cancel the entire order if you want to return one or two specific products. After the returned items have been quality checked by Daraz, a partial refund will be issued to the customer on an item-level basis for each bundle. To submit a return request, customers must do so within 14 days of receiving their order. Decisions on returns and refunds will be taken by Daraz in its sole discretion. Customers attempting to circumvent the terms and conditions and abuse subsidies by creating new accounts will be unable to place their orders.
