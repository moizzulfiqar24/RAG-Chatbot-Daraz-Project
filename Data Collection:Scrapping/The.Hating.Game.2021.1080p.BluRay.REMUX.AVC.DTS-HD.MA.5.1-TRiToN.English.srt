I emailed it to

Eh, lower than projected.

But they are better than Q2.

101
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,864
And I talked to the marketing
team about alternative print

00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,100
Yes, and Friday after
Thanksgiving will not be a paid

162
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,186
holiday, FYI.

163
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,355
Okay, Richard and I have
an announcement to make:

164
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,190
we're adding a new
position to the team.

165
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,151
Yes, we're going to be hiring
a managing director who will

166
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,987
oversee each department
and he will report to me.

167
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,198
He or she will
report to both of us.

168
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:32,327
The job is open to external
applicants, naturally, but...

169
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,955
I'd very much like
to hire from within.

170
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,457
Yeah, we will be putting
together an independent panel

171
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,668
since we don't
always see eye-to-eye.

172
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,045
The final candidates will make
their presentations to the board

173
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,005
after the New Year.

174
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,841
May the best man win.

175
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:51,888

176
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,354
That job is mine, Shortcake.

177
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,981
Oh, your
confidence is compelling,

178
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,190
but you forget one thing.

179
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,858
- Hm?
- Everyone hates you.

180
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,235
Oh, they don't
hate me, they fear me,

181
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,361
which makes me effective.

182
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,821
[laughs] You know,
when I'm your boss,

183
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,240
I will require you to do
everything I say with a smile.

184
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,617
When I'm your boss, I'm gonna
work you so hard that you start

185
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,077
using the office as
your home address.

186
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,080
When I'm your boss, I
will enforce casual Fridays.

187

Hawaiian shirts mandatory.

188
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,667
When I'm your boss, I'm
implementing a new dress code.

189
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,878
No more looking like an
elementary school librarian.

190
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,216
[sighs] If you get
the job, I'll resign.

191
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,926
- Really?
- Just like you will if I do.

192
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,803
- I don't quit.
- Then I'll fire you.

193
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,014
Ah, but I'm incapable of
giving you that pleasure.

194
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:35,682
Aw, it's not the first time
you've said that to a woman,

195
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,225
- is it?
- [laughs]

196
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,185
Then we agree: if
one of us gets the job,

197
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,186
the other has to quit.

198
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,022
Fine, agreed.

199
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,234
[Lucy] Oh, hey, Danny.

200
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,277
I come bearing gifts.

201
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,237
- Oh!
- [Danny] Oh, sorry.

202
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,239
Shoulda... waited
for some eye contact.

203
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,490
The new book!

204
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,909
[gasps] That's so
nice of you, thank you.

205
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,453
Designers got
some advanced copies,

206
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,121
so... no big deal.

207
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,497
Oh, no.

208
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,082
This is the cover?

209
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,334
Sorry, Bexley made us do it.

210
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,754
The book's about an
archaeologist with autism.

211
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,173
I mean, does he
even read the jackets?

212
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,299
Doubtful.

213
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,425
Oh!

214
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,259
And, uh, this came
for you in the mail,

215
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,677
so I took the liberty to...

216
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,970
Oh!

217
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,513
0 for two.

218
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,183
Are you ordering your
tiny clothes online again?

219
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,143
Just a box small enough
for your withered heart.

220
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,103
- Ah...
- Bet it's another Smurf.

221
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,521
Another Smurf?

222
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,106
As in multiple Smurfs?

223
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,068
So is this like a Smurf village
that you're putting together?

224
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,319
- Are you doing little, like...
- Okay, just...

225
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,196

Oh, she's got the
whole collection.

227
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,533
How adorable.

228
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,285
Will you shut up?

229
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,787
Thank you for the
delivery, Danny.

230
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,662
Anytime.

231
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,122
Yes, Danny, thank you so much.

00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:42,791
[Danny] You got it, JT.

233

dreamboats on the flip.

235
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:51,800
- Hit it.
- No.

236
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,343
Okay.

237
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,761
Bye.

238
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,599
That poor sap thinks
you're flirting with him.

239
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,309
The same way people think
you're flirting with me?

240
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,478
Shortcake, if I was
flirting with you,

241
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,604
you would know it.

242
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,397
I didn't know frat
boys knew how to flirt.

243
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,234
I thought they just
roofied girls' drinks.

244
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,781

It really grabs ya, right?

00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,375
Mm, yes, it's... it's
definitely eye-catching.

271

It's not 'Stripping Time, '
it's 'Stripping <i>Time</i>!'

272
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,772
This has nothing
to do with strippers.

version of himself.

275
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,904
Did you seriously just refer
to the cover as "eye-catching?"

276
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,448
Looks like it was designed
by a horny fifth grader.

277
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,658
Not exactly consistent
with the tone of the novel.

278
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:42,368
Since when do you read
the books we publish?

279
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,621
I was just trying to
fill my Good Reads quota.

280
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,872
Oh, your one book of the year?

281
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,458
You do know comic
books don't count, right?

282
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,376
I fell asleep three
times reading the first page.

283
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,296
Well, it is exhausting to
read above your grade level.

284
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,423
Maybe you're not ready
for chapter books yet.

285
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,925
It was boring.

286
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,719
It was a masterpiece before
Bexley cut 200 pages to make it

287
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,679
more of an airport read.

288
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,307
At least he kept in some of
the landscape descriptions.

289
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,268
Oh, yeah, it was thrilling
reading about the topography of

290
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,478
Fort Ticonderoga.

291
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,396
Whatever, I loved it.

292
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,898
So, big Thanksgiving plans?

293
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,234
You gonna be posting some Smurf
fanfic and eating cranberry

294
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,318
sauce out of a can?

295
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,903
And what about the
Templeman family?

296
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,947
Drinking the blood of a virgin
and then staring at each other

297
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,656
in silence?

298
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,490
Oh, how'd you know?

299
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,950
We're looking for donations.

00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,329

303
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,498
Four complaints this week, four!

room incident on Monday.

305
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,960
[Lucy] Here we go.

306
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:32,335
[Josh] Are we
ready for our lesson?

307
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,461
Okay?

308
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,338
This is a comma,
and this is a period.

309
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,839
When you take a period and...

310
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,424
You better put that doughnut
hole away or I'm gonna shove it

311
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,676
up your semicolon!

312
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,220
[Josh] You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Shrimp?

313
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,888
Mommy and Daddy fight sometimes.

314
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,348
We have discussions.

315
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,059
Like how Mommy constantly
forgets to CC Daddy on

316
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,519
company-wide memos.

317
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,688
Or how Daddy has a cork up
his ass about the format of

318
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,897
quarterly reports.

319
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,107
Mommy and Daddy?

320
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,775

Awesome.

So, where are you from?

654
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,246
Vermont.

655
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,415
[Danny] Green
Mountain State, Ethan Allen.

That's right.

657
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,252
Yeah, my parents are
strawberry farmers.

hobby farm, too!

goats, chickens,

661
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,425
the whole thing!

662
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,259
Wait, are you serious?

663
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,302
[Danny] I am serious.

664
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,595
How did I not
know this about you?

665
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:00,721
I don't know.

666
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,181
But we got Karen
and Sharon the sheep,

667
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,184
we got Percy Pig, we
got Bonito the queen bee,

668
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,268
and we got Phillip the goat.

669
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,769
You know about goat parkour?

670

any surface pulling this,

00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,414

our food actually comes from

- I didn't know that.
- Really, so...

685
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,421
Okay, so wait, wait, do you
have to wear one of those bee

686
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:35,881

687

Culkin in 'My Girl'-level

every time I go home,

make me a nerd, okay?

975
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:38,960
[Lucy] Ow.

976
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,336
Sorry.

977
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,631
Ugh.

978
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,428
[knocking]

979
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,555
- [Josh] Still alive in there?
- [Lucy] [mumbling] Yeah.

980
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,307
[Josh] All right, sit up.

981
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:54,726
Time to take your temp.

982
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,733
Open up, Rambo.

983
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,526
There you go.

984
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:07,113
You're in my bedroom.

985
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,950
I'm wearing Sleepysaurus.

986
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:12,619
[Josh] Try not to
talk, Shortcake.

987
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,996
I know that's hard for you.

988
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,250
Here we go.

989
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,294
102.8.

990
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,589
Ooh, that's not very
nice, Mr. Thermometer.

991
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,758
[laughs]

992
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,177
Are you laughing?

993
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:32,847
Oh, I must be hallucinating.

994
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,390
Sit tight.

995
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,184
I'll be back.

996
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,025
[Lucy] [mumbling]
No, there's two of you.

997
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,071
[sighs] Josh must have
gotten wet after midnight.

998
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,199
- Lucy?
- Mm.

999
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:51,866
[Patrick] I'm a doctor.

1000
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,951
How are you feeling?

1001
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:53,993
Not so good.

1002
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,079
She's got a fever of 103.

1003
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,122
All right, let's sit you up.

1004
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,582
Okay.

1005
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,084
[groans]

1006
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,629
[sighs]

1007
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:09,592
You are really handsome.

1008
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,594
[laughs] Thank you.

1009
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:15,056
People always say Josh
is the good-looking one.

1010
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,017
Oh, you're his brother.

1011
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,062
Oh, you must've wanted to beat
him up so much when you were a

1012
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,106
- kid.
- [laughs]

1013
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:23,898
I like her.

1014
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:25,316
Oh, she's very special.

1015
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,818
Wait, can you tell me
embarrassing things about him?

1016
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,486
You must know all
the best stuff.

1017
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:30,238
Well, um...

1018
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,864
He used to dress
up like a dog...

1019
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,199
No...

1020
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,701
Make our mom walk him
around the block. [laughs]

1021
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:36,703
[laughing] Oh, my God, this
is the best day of my life.

1022
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,454
I was a kid, thank you.

1023
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,497
He was 12.

1024
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,289
[gasp] No!

1025
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,833
Oh, Josh, that's too old.

1026
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,710
All right, thank you very much
for the house call, Doctor.

1027
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,128
Time to go.

1028
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,879
Laughter's the
best medicine, right?

1029
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,631
[laughs]

1030
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,136
[groaning] No...

1031
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,763
You did all the right things.

1032
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,099
You would've been good at this.

1033
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,936
I'm not trying to
be a dick, come on.

1034
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:04,313
I'm just saying, you did good.

1035
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,110
So...

1036
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,320
you ever gonna RSVP?

1037
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:14,240
It's just that, you know, Mindy
and I need a final head count.

1038
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,325
Yeah, yeah, uh...

1039
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,036
I've just been slammed at work.

1040
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,287
Sorry.

1041
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:21,414
Look, man...

1042
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,750
it's awkward, I get it.

1043
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:26,961
But when your brother
gets married, you show up.

1044
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,337
Bring a plus one.

1045
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:30,089
[Josh] Oh yeah, right,
'cause that's what we need:

1046
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:33,509
more witnesses to our
absurd family drama.

1047
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,012
[Patrick] Keep her fluids up.

1048
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,724
Call me if the fever gets worse.

1049
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,184
Thank you, Pat.

1050
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,935
[Patrick] Thank
you, little brother.

1051
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,812
[door opens]

1052
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,612
- [Josh] How are we doin'?
- Hey.

1053
00:42:53,154 --> 00:42:55,239
I brought you a little water.

1054
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,160
N... I'm not a baby.

1055
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,578
You already broke
two glasses earlier,

1056
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:03,247
so better safe than sorry.

1057
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:05,833
There you go.

1058
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,504
My mom always gave me
strawberry juice when I was

1059
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,172
sick.

1060
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,007
What did yours do?

1061
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,718
Oh, they were always too
busy treating other people.

1062
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:17,095
If you weren't in
cardiac arrest,

1063
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,806
your ailment
didn't exactly rank.

1064
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,390
Is your whole family doctors?

1065
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:23,142
And surgeons.

1066
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,269
Except me.

1067
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,024
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like a young Dennis

1068
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,025
Quaid?

1069
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,485
[laughs]

1070
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,237
I think it's time to take
your temp again, Shortcake.

1071
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,030
No, stop calling me that.

1072
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:37,615
Oh, not a chance.

1073
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,034
Watching you pretend to hate
that nickname is the best part

1074
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,619
of my day.

1075
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,996
You changed shirts.

1076
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,374
You look like an Old Navy model.

1077
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,834
My brother brought it for me.

1078
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,752
You puked on the
other one, remember?

1079
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,754
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm.

1080
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:57,760
Dove gray, white, powder
blue, window pane, true blue.

1081
00:43:57,844 --> 00:44:00,138
- [Josh] What's that?
- Your shirts.

1082
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:03,182
Always in the same order.

1083
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,936
I guess I am that predictable.

1084
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,647
Yeah, you only
surprised me once.

1085
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,316
- [Josh] When was that?
- The elevator.

1086
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,986
And...

1087
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,071
what did you think about that?

1088
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,906
[sighs]

1089
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,202
Yeah, I thought
it was really hot.

1090
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:32,253
Are we playing the staring game?

1091
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,255
It's my favorite.

1092
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,217
I like the way you look at me.

1093
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,723
[Josh] Get some rest.

1094
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,313
[sighs]

1095
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,451
Josh?

1096
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,329
Oh, she lives!

1097
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,332
Why are you
cleaning my apartment?

1098
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,875
Oh, actually, I
didn't clean it.

1099
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,668
I demoed the whole thing and
rebuilt it from the ground up

1100
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:13,794
with a team of elves.

1101
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:15,213
Figured it was easier.

1102
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:17,924
Okay, just 'cause I'm not
turned on by the smell of

1103
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,133
cleaning supplies...

1104
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,510
Weird, that doesn't
sound like "Thank you"...

1105
00:45:21,594 --> 00:45:23,012
- [Lucy] No...
- But you're very welcome.

1106
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,096
Thank you.

1107
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,431
Seriously, thank
you for everything.

1108
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,433
But just... would
you... stop, stop.

1109
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,142
This is weird.

1110
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:29,769
This is way too weird.

1111
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,730
Oh, and if you use any
of this against me...

1112
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,858
Oh, right, because knowing
the consistency of your vomit's

1113
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:37,485
really gonna give me
a competitive edge.

1114
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:38,527
No, Josh, stop.

1115
00:45:38,611 --> 00:45:39,946
No, I get it, it's fine.

1116
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:42,448
My brother left a prescription
for you on the table.

1117
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:44,116
See you at the office.

1118
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,079
[Lucy] [sighs]

1119
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,292
Shit.

1120
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,923
[Danny] Did you know daisies
are found on every continent

1121
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,509
except Antartica-arctica?

1122
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,885
Oh, gotta go.

1123
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:03,928
Lucy!

1124
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,388
- [clears throat]
- [Lucy] Hi!

1125
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:06,347
What are you doing here?

1126
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,391
I got you these.

1127
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:09,558
Always with the flowers.

1128
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:10,893
You're very sweet.

1129
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:12,186
How are you feeling?

1130
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,189
Like my body survived a
violent alien abduction.

1131
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,942
Fun fact about alien
abductions: not violent.

1132
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,528
They get a bad rep 'cause of all
the probe stuff but my personal

1133
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,738
feelings are that aliens
are actually people from,

Nick Bostrom's 'Simulation

40 years ago 'til now,

4,000 years or four million

good candidates, Lucy.

How much of a shot do I have?

1203

You never asked.

And I rely on you to do the
parts of my job that I hate

1214
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:22,209
doing, which is why you'd
make a great managing director.

1215
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,929
I'm trying to say thank you.

No need.

How do you know about that?

No, what I want is

the American Revolution,

00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,047
the British used to keep
prisoners of war on a boat in

the East River?

1268

what to do with the bodies,

There you are.

I've been looking
all over for you.

Yeah, so I thought maybe you

Okay, thank you.

Sure.

there's no chance for anything

Hm.

I mean, don't take
this the wrong way,

1514
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,493
I just figured

Nope, pistols
and swords at dawn.

Given the choice, I go

01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:10,371
I... I don't think that he's
making books, Sweetheart.

1936
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:13,374
I think he's making coffee for
somebody who's making books.

1937
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,084
And by the way, it's
none of your business.

1938
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:17,419
Don't speak to her that way.

1939
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,922
Okay, well since you
know nothing about your son,

1940
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,674
I'll just... I'll... I'll
fill you in real quick.

1941
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,718
Josh is the person that our
sales and finance divisions

1942
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:25,594
report to.

1943
01:19:25,678 --> 01:19:27,554
They are scared shitless of him.

1944
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,349
I have seen grown men run around
like ants triple-checking their

1945
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:32,893
numbers because Josh
always finds their mistakes.

1946
01:19:32,977 --> 01:19:33,978
Lucy, you don't have to.

1947
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:35,521
It's fine.

1948
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:36,981
I'm sorry, I know I'm making a
really big scene and I'm sorry.

1949
01:19:37,064 --> 01:19:38,649
I... I like all of you. [laughs]

1950
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,150
Um, except you.

1951
01:19:40,234 --> 01:19:42,361
But I... I can't listen to this.

1952
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:43,946
Oh, and for the
record, Josh's boss,

1953
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,199
who is CEO in title only, is a
sleazy toad who can barely tie

1954
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,200
his own shoelaces.

1955
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,160
Josh runs that place.

1956
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:51,996
Actually, we both do.

1957
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,415
And the only reason that B&G
didn't completely implode after

1958
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,167
the merger is because Josh
oversaw a reduction of the

1959
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,545
workforce by 35
percent, and because of him,

1960
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,171
200 people kept their jobs.

1961
01:20:01,255 --> 01:20:02,339
And so he's not a doctor.

1962
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,799
Who the fuck cares?

1963
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:05,384
He's smart.

1964
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,594
Your son is tough and he has
made me a lot better at my job

1965
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,305
by having to compete with him.

1966
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:11,307
Don't get me wrong, he
drives me absolutely insane,

1967
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:12,808
which is apparently hereditary.

1968
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,935
But your son is amazing.

1969
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:15,894
And the fact that
you can't see that,

1970
01:20:15,978 --> 01:20:18,230
that is a goddamn shame.

1971
01:20:21,442 --> 01:20:24,445
In conclusion, uh,
congratulations to the bride and

1972
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:25,571
groom!

1973
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:27,781
Just amazing.

1974
01:20:27,865 --> 01:20:30,367
Um, let's go home.

1975
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,703
Anthony, sir, it's
been a real treat.

1976
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,539
Elaine, it was
lovely meeting you.

1977
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,375
[whispering] I'll call you.

1978
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,388
[chuckles]

1979
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,517
So, what now?

1980
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,561
- Naked time?
- [Josh] [laughs]

1981
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:59,063
After naked time?

1982
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:01,106
Rehydration.

1983
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,404
Lucy, I've had a
lot of women...

1984
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:10,532
I seriously hope there's
an end to that sentence.

1985
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:12,326
[laughs]

1986
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,788
I've had a lot of women tell me
that I'm... I'm not the kind of

1987
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,915
guy you settle down with.

1988
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:20,918
I'm the one-night-stand.

1989
01:21:21,919 --> 01:21:24,171
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

1990
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,215
I hope not.

1991
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:31,470
I don't understand you.

1992
01:21:31,553 --> 01:21:34,264
I seriously
thought you hated me.

1993
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,016
Never.

1994
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,061
Never, not for one second.

1995
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,106
And I can prove it to you.

1996
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:45,442
All right, you
have to come in here.

1997
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:46,819
Okay.

1998
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,446
And I'm gonna need to take this.

1999
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,532
I thought you
weren't feeling naked time.

2000
01:21:51,615 --> 01:21:52,950
[chuckles]

2001
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,034
You're kinda giving me
mixed signals here, Templeman.

2002
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:55,494
[laughs] We're not
going to the bed.

2003
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:59,039
You have to stand... right here.

2004
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,333
- [laughs] Okay.
- Now...

2005
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,711
tell me what you see.

2006
01:22:04,795 --> 01:22:07,464
Um, well...

2007
01:22:07,548 --> 01:22:10,717
my hair's a little scraggly
and my lipstick's faded.

2008
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:12,678
- You're perfect.
- [laughs]

2009
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,471
Guess again.

2010
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,890
[sighs] Oh!

2011
01:22:17,599 --> 01:22:18,809
My dress!

2012
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,561
Look.

2013
01:22:21,311 --> 01:22:22,855
Like a tree frog.

2014
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:24,565
[laughs]

2015
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:26,275
What exactly does that prove?

2016
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,528
Your dress isn't the only
thing that matches your eyes.

2017
01:22:32,698 --> 01:22:34,575
Oh, my God.

2018
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,492
Wait, did you...

2019
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:36,743
How about this?

2020
01:22:36,827 --> 01:22:38,912
Let's play a different game.

2021
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,873
The "Starting Over" game.

2022
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,749
Hi.

2023
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,960
I'm Joshua
Templeman, nice to meet you.

2024
01:22:45,043 --> 01:22:46,879
Hi. [laughs]

2025
01:22:46,962 --> 01:22:48,505
Um...

2026
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,340
I'm Lucy Hutton.

2027
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:54,303
I'm from Charlotte, Vermont,
where they grow strawberries.

2028
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:57,181
And because of that, I'm
gonna call you "Shortcake."

2029
01:22:57,264 --> 01:23:00,225
It'll be a dead
giveaway that I love you.

2030
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,687
You're freaking out.

2031
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:04,771
No.

2032
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:07,733
- [Josh] Don't freak out.
- No, I just...

2033
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:10,194
I just...

2034
01:23:10,277 --> 01:23:12,279
I... I am not... I am
not prepared for this.

2035
01:23:12,362 --> 01:23:13,697
What do you mean?

2036
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:15,365
After New Year's, one of
us is gonna be out of a job.

2037
01:23:15,449 --> 01:23:18,410
Any relationship we tried, it
would be over before it started.

2038
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,536
Well, maybe not.

2039
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,954
Maybe nobody has to quit.

2040
01:23:21,038 --> 01:23:22,414
No, this would never work.

2041
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:23,540
You know that, okay?

2042
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:24,791
We would kill each other.

2043
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,502
[Josh] [laughs]

2044
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:28,587
Luce, I know you.

2045
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,757
I know that you blot your
lips twice before you throw your

2046
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,675
tissue away.

2047
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:38,180
I know that your voice drops
an octave when you get upset.

2048
01:23:38,263 --> 01:23:40,349
I know you chew your lower lip
when you're doing something you

2049
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,434
don't wanna do.

2050
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,812
And I know that
you're scared right now.

2051
01:23:46,396 --> 01:23:48,649
But you don't have to be.

2052
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:52,402
I'm in this.

2053
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:54,571
And you can trust that.

[Richard] It's a dangerous
time for men these days, Josh.

2066
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:24,745
If we don't stick together,
manic pixie twits like Lucy

2067
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,831
Hutton, they're gonna be running
this country on lipstick and

2068
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:29,416
feelings.

2069
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,543
I can tell you I didn't start
this company to have my balls

2070
01:25:31,627 --> 01:25:34,129
crushed by some
nitwit in a push-up bra.

2071
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,213
Do you hear me?

2072
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:36,256
Loud and clear.

2073
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:37,924
I have a vision
for this company,

2074
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:40,761
and I'm counting on
you to make it happen.

2075
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:42,638
So, do you have a strategy?

2076
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:43,889
- Do you have a plan?
- I do.

2077
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,974
It's already underway.

2078
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:48,477
I told her she'd back off if
you let her think that she could

2079
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,354
pet the pony. [laughs]

2080
01:25:50,437 --> 01:25:52,147
I'm glad you took my advice.

2081
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,691
Is there anything else I can do
to help you cinch this thing?

2082
01:25:54,775 --> 01:25:56,068
No.

2083
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,944
No, no, no, I... I don't
need any help beating her.

2084
01:25:58,028 --> 01:25:59,279
[Richard] All right,
I'm sure you don't.

2085
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:00,906
Get on it, then.

2086
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,327
Hey, are you free?

2087
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:08,622
I'm heading to the
coffeeshop right now.

2088
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:11,833
[ding]

2089
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,965
[Danny] So he's
sexually gaslighting you?

2090
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:21,176
That is diabolical.

2091
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,969
I guess it makes sense; you're
not gonna work as hard if you're

2092
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:24,888
crushing on him.

2093
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,724
I wonder what it's like to be
a dude who uses his raw animal

2094
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,935
magnetism as a weapon.

2095
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:31,937
Yeah, but it's
one thing to flirt.

2096
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,272
It's a whole other thing to
pretend like you have actual

2097
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:35,357
feelings.

2098
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,818
I just... I feel
like such an idiot.

2099
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,946
Are you sure it's okay that
we're talking about all this?

2100
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,322
Yeah.

2101
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,783
I mean, I'm basically the
mayor of the Friendzone,

2102
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:48,829
so I'm hip, safe
space, carry on.

2103
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:53,750
I just cannot believe I let
myself get played like this.

2104
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:57,629
I mean, he seemed so sincere.

2105
01:26:58,338 --> 01:27:00,757
Well, fear not,
my sweet friend.

2106
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:02,426
You are going to
nail that interview,

2107
01:27:02,509 --> 01:27:06,012
get the job, and then order will
be restored to the universe.

2108
01:27:06,096 --> 01:27:07,472
Yes.

2109
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,766
Well, justice demands that
Josh live a long life alone,

2110
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:11,560
sucking on Bexley's nasty nuts.

2111
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,270
- [laughs]
- [Lucy] So...

2112
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,023
- Oh, hey, Josh.
- What are you doing here?

2113
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:18,817
I was looking for you.

2114
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,278
Thought I'd join
you for a coffee.

2115
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:24,823
I don't like you enough
to get a coffee with you.

2116
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:28,660
My mistake.

2117
01:27:31,413 --> 01:27:33,832
[whispering] Solid burn.

2118
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,375
[chuckles]

2119
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,879
[sighs]

2120
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:41,548
Do we have confirmation that
the London Review is featuring

2121
01:27:41,631 --> 01:27:42,466
'Stripping Time?'

2122
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,009
CC'd you on the email.

2123
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:46,803
No, I'm looking at my inbox and
it's not here, you sociopath.

2124
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:50,474
Well, then you're either
blind or just lying, as usual.

2125
01:27:50,557 --> 01:27:51,558
I don't lie.

2126
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,101
You lie all the time.

2127
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:55,228
You just don't see it as lying
because you tell people what

2128
01:27:55,312 --> 01:27:56,438
they wanna hear.

2129
01:27:56,521 --> 01:27:57,314
What?

2130
01:27:57,397 --> 01:27:58,690
Name one time I've done that.

2131
01:27:58,774 --> 01:28:01,860
You told me you
weren't interested in Danny.

2132
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,653
Wow.

2133
01:28:04,321 --> 01:28:05,864
Wow.

2134
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,365
That is amazing.

2135
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,493
You are actually gonna play
this thing all the way through,

2136
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:10,869
aren't you?

2137
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:11,870
And see, that's
what I don't get.

2138
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:13,413
Throw me off my game, fine.

2139
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,956
Flirt with me, mess
with my head, whatever.

2140
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,459
But why would you want to keep
me from dating someone else?

2141
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:19,002
Danny is nice!

2142
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:19,920
And I'm not.

2143
01:28:20,003 --> 01:28:22,005
I thought you were...

2144
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,257
somewhere under the
layers of psychological damage.

2145
01:28:24,341 --> 01:28:27,636
But it turns out you would just
do whatever it takes to win and

2146
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:28,845
make your daddy proud.

2147
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,430
And you know what?

2148
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:33,266
I am so glad that I threw up all
over you 'cause I am this close

2149
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:34,059
to doing it again!

2150
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,435
What is wrong with you?!

2151
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:36,978
[whispering] I
heard you with Bexley!

2152
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,522
And?

2153
01:28:38,605 --> 01:28:40,190
And I bet if he knew you'd had
a hand all the way up my skirt,

2154
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,900
he'd throw a
parade in your honor!

2155
01:28:41,983 --> 01:28:44,402
- That's not...
- Hey, Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

2156
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:46,530
I'm gonna need those projections
on my desk by Friday.

2157
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:47,531
I don't have the time.

2158
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:48,657
Lucy can do it.

2159
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:49,991
[Richard] Hutton!

2160
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:51,952
Care to grow some hair
on your nuts and step up?

2161
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,620
You know,
Richard, I would love to,

2162
01:28:53,703 --> 01:28:56,039
but I doubt a nitwit in a
push-up bra would be much help

2163
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:57,582
to you.

2164
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,963
Josh, projections,
on my desk Friday.

2165
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,258
There is no way in hell I am
letting you and Bexley destroy

2166
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:07,759
this place.

[Helen] Lucy?

2184
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:15,076
Hi.

2185
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,786
You have a call at two with TLS,
unless you want me to take it.

2186
01:30:16,870 --> 01:30:18,163
I know the catalogue.

2187
01:30:18,246 --> 01:30:19,331
It's all yours.

2188
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:21,082
Wait, do you
know where Josh is?

2189
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,126
I haven't seen
him since yesterday.

2190
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:24,753
That's weird, right?

2191
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:25,962
The week of the presentation?

2192
01:30:26,046 --> 01:30:28,340
He's... he's up to something.

2193
01:30:28,423 --> 01:30:30,884
I wouldn't put it past him.

2194
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:32,385
You ready for this?

2195
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:33,845
Hell yes.

2196
01:30:33,929 --> 01:30:35,513
I will bring my A game.

2197
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:37,849

01:31:01,748 --> 01:31:04,000
[laughs]

2205
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,379
[Julie] Lucy!

2206
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:09,089
This is my boyfriend's niece,
Daisy... the one I told you

2207
01:31:09,172 --> 01:31:11,216
about for the internship.

2208
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,176
This is Daisy?

2209
01:31:13,259 --> 01:31:15,178
Like the flower.

2210
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,434
[sighs]

2211
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,854
No.

2212
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:27,273
Absolutely not.

2213
01:31:27,357 --> 01:31:28,316
No, but you said that...

2214
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:30,360
I got steamrolled
and you know it.

2215
01:31:30,443 --> 01:31:32,779
I'm sorry, you seem
like a lovely girl,

2216
01:31:32,862 --> 01:31:34,614
but you actually couldn't
have picked a worse time.

2217
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:37,117
And you still haven't
turned in your monthly report.

2218
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,159
Oh, yes, I wanted to
talk to you about that...

2219
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:39,327
[Lucy] No, don't
worry about it.

2220
01:31:39,411 --> 01:31:40,412
I already talked to
Alan, I got the numbers,

2221
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:42,247
and I did the
report myself... again.

2222
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:43,832
[sighs] You're such an angel.

2223
01:31:43,915 --> 01:31:45,375
No, I'm not an angel.

2224
01:31:45,458 --> 01:31:47,669
I'm a patsy and I am done.

2225
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:49,254
It's a migraine or
a sprained wrist.

2226
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:51,673
I mean, three months ago, you
couldn't turn in the report

2227
01:31:51,756 --> 01:31:54,175
because a bird flew in your face
coming off the subway and you

2228
01:31:54,259 --> 01:31:55,927
were too
distraught to concentrate.

2229
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:57,303
It was a big bird...

2230
01:31:57,387 --> 01:31:59,055
And while I sympathize
with your various plights...

2231
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,807
You don't sound sympathetic.

2232
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:02,100
She doesn't sound sympathetic.

2233
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,728
I'm gonna have to
ask you to do your job.

2234
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,524
I'm disappointed in you.

2235
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:11,192
Well...

2236
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:15,655
[Josh] Impressive.

2237
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:16,948
[Lucy] Thank you.

2238
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,200
Not that I... need
your validation.

2239
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:20,869
[woman] Thank you for coming.

2240
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:21,870
Lucy Hutton?

2241
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:23,163
You're up next.

2242
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,873
Okay. [sighs]

2243
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,378
One thing...

2244
01:32:31,004 --> 01:32:34,132
If you get this job, are you
actually gonna let Bexley gut

2245
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:36,301
the literary department?

2246
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,511
It's his business.

2247
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,138
He can do what he wants with it.

2248

That's all I needed to know.

2251
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:49,856
This is the first chapter of
a new book from best-selling

author Emily Powery.

2253
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:57,155
I propose creating a cross-media
platform so that people can

2254
01:32:57,238 --> 01:33:00,742
download e-books or audiobooks
and then have conversations with

2255
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:03,161
other readers and the writer.

2256

How would that work?

2257
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:06,289
Well, once you
finished a chapter,

2258
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:09,125
you are then directed to a
community group to discuss the

2259
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,251
story.

2260
01:33:10,335 --> 01:33:12,587
And the writer is
part of that community.

2261
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,547
They publish a
chapter at a time,

2262
01:33:14,631 --> 01:33:16,341
like the old 19th
century serials,

2263
01:33:16,424 --> 01:33:19,135
and then join the conversation
with the readers before they

2264
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:21,137
write the next chapter.

2265

Interesting.

2266

Oh, it's beautiful.

2280

Mr. Darcy was such a
great romantic hero:

decision to make today.

2298
01:34:39,048 --> 01:34:41,593
I think it goes without saying
that this merger has been a

2299
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:46,764
little bumpy, but I think that
B&G is positioned now to become

2300
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:49,767
a major literary powerhouse.

didn't need help beating me...

It's because I had
