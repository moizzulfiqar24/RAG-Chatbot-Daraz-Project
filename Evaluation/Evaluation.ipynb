    "candidate_textMain_Mistral = \"Absolutely, Daraz allows sellers to create product bundles as a sales promotion strategy. Product bundling is an effective way to differentiate deals from competitors, especially in high-priced categories, and it provides several benefits. Firstly, bundles enable sellers to sell low-cost items together with more expensive ones, offering customers a better value for their money. This can be a great opportunity to clear inventory of certain products. Additionally, bundles are an excellent way to attract customers and increase conversion rates. By selling a package or set of goods for a lower price than the customer would pay if they bought each item separately, sellers can enhance overall performance and boost sales. There are two common types of product bundling: 1. Buy One Get One Free (BOGO): This is a form of sales promotion where the customer receives one product for free when they buy another product. It is not actually half price, but it can be an effective way to generate interest and sales. 2. Combo: This is a promotion where different products are sold together as a set with one or more items at discounted prices. Moreover, if a seller is selling only custom-made products, they should aim to have a minimum of 5 such products in their bundle. As for the benefits of product customization, it can help match customer demand, increase sales and competitive edge, boost customer engagement, build brand loyalty, and gain valuable market research. By offering customized products, sellers can cater to individual customer preferences, which can lead to repeat business and positive word-of-mouth marketing.\"\n",

Once you have selected your products, click on the \\\"Create Bundle\\\" button.\"\n",

The benefits of product customization include matching customer demand, increasing sales and competitive edge, building brand loyalty, and gaining market research insights. By creating bundles, sellers can differentiate themselves from competitors and attract customers who may be interested in purchasing a set of products at a lower price. Additionally, bundle sales can help sellers clear their inventory and reduce costs associated with promoting individual products. Overall, product bundling can be an effective marketing strategy for sellers looking to increase conversions, sales, and overall performance.\"\n",
    "candidate_textMain_Zephyr = \"Yes, you can definitely make product bundles on Daraz. Daraz offers a feature called \\\"Bundles\\\" which allows sellers to create promotional offers by bundling multiple products together and selling them at a discounted price. This is a great way to increase sales, attract customers, and clear inventory. There are different types of product bundling that you can choose from, such as \\\"Buy 1 Get 1 Free\\\" or \\\"Combo\\\" bundles.  In \\\"Buy 1 Get 1 Free\\\" bundles, you offer a second product for free when the customer buys a certain product. This is a popular promotion that helps you differentiate your deals from competitors, especially in high-priced competitive categories. Customers are attracted to this type of bundle because they get more value for their money. In \\\"Combo\\\" bundles, you sell multiple products together as a set at a discounted price. This is a great opportunity to sell low-cost items as part of a bundle. It also helps you move slow-moving inventory by bundling it with more popular products. To create a bundle on Daraz, you need to have a minimum of 5 custom products if you are selling only custom-made products.
