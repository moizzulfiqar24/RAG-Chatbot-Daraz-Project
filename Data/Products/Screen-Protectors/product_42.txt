        "Step 2 : Stick the key hole with a label,and then use a knife or scissor open the liquid adhesive box,drop it on the screen(It is recommended that the glue be poured completely.The glue that drops on the screen can't have air bubbles, if there is air bubble, use the needle to pierce the air bubble to let go air. )",
        "Step 3 : Peel off  the mask film from the glass,then place the screen protector to a suitable position on your device SLOWLY. PLEASE DO NOT LIFT AND PRESS THE GLASS TO LET THE ADHESIVE SPREAD,JUST LET IT AUTOMATIC DISPERSION.(Very important)",
        "Step 4 : Wait for about half a minute to let the adhesive spread and level.",
        "Step 5 : If the adhesive overflow, wipe off with a clean cloth. After checking the retention criteria for the mobile phone's tempered film, the lamp was turned back and forth several times around the edge of the phone, and after 3 seconds of initial curing (not in the middle), the edge glue was wiped again until the glue overflowed. (Prevent white edges or long bubbles on edges)",
        "Step 6 : Wait for the exhaust to complete, after the glue overflows cleanly, after the positioning standard of the tempered film is satisfied, turn on the light. Otherwise scrapped material."
